Students will be introduced to the building blocks of English in a structured and systematic way. This course will focus on decoding English words to make reading more fluent and accurate. Students will learn the most common phonemes of English, the English syllable types, and the most common ways that larger, multisyllabic words can be divided to make them manageable for reading and spelling. Some English spelling patterns will be introduced, along with an emphasis on building and expanding students' vocabulary. Reading Essentials I is the first of two courses using the Orton-Gillingham approach."
