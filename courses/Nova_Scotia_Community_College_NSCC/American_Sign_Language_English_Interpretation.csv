Learners will critically analyze English texts, the source language, and consecutively produce an equivalent message into ASL, the target language. This correlates with concurrent work in the concurrent course, ASL to English Interpreting Skills. Using a variety of readings, discussions, feedback techniques and isolated subtasks, learners will gradually integrate these component skills through prepared and unprepared consecutive interpretations.

In this course, learners begin to interpret (versus translate). Learners will analyze ASL texts (the source language), and consecutively produce an equivalent message in English (the target language). This correlates with concurrent work in English to ASL Interpreting Skills. Learners practice isolated subtasks and gradually integrate these component skills into consecutive interpretations. Discussion of interpreting issues will be a regular part of the semester's work. Learners are also expected to keep up to date on news and current affairs via a daily national or regional newspaper. News quizzes will be a regular part of our week. "

Unlike consecutive interpretation, simultaneous interpretation requires processing information and transmitting that information into a second language within the same time frame.From this semester on, emphasis will be placed on the importance of being able to work in both modes as learners aim for comfort while switching back and forth, as necessary. Learners will do guided drills in class but also do self-directed interpreting and analysis of interpretations on their own, in small groups. Online discussion of topics on interpretation will also be part of the course. "

Working in a variety of classes on campus, learners have the opportunity to practice interpreting in front of a live audience without being accountable to a Deaf consumer. In addition to this, learners spend time in the community logging time, learning about the Deaf and interpreting communities, as well as themselves. Then later in the semester, learners participate in their first two-week placement, applying their skills and knowledge learned. "

The course picks up where part one left off and focuses on the remaining four interpretation features in Taylor's text: Structuring Space, Grammar, Interpreting and Composure and Appearance. Using the textbook, its descriptions of the relevant features, and guidance from class discussions, learners will produce interpretation samples on video. Learners then apply the assigned features to the task of analyzing their own and other's work. This gives learners an opportunity to practice discussing where an interpretation is effective or unsuccessful. Additional work is aimed at the same kind of analysis in ASL to English work. "
