Investigating land-use planning instruments such as Integrated Community Sustainability Plans (ICSP’s) and Municipal Planning Strategies (MPS) will provide learners with a foundation for comprehending sustainable development at the community level. Learners will analyze the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainable development versus conventional development. Learners will research planning methods used in the preparation of planning studies such as population projections, housing needs analysis, and transportation studies. Learners will be introduced to the exploration of e-government and the role of web development to provide and improve services, transactions and interactions with citizens, businesses, and other stakeholders.
