Learners will begin the process of creating dynamic drawings of human and animal forms in motion.Learners will also engage in the process of a gallery education, by critiquing and exhibiting their work. By working as a team to critique, mount and exhibit their work in a public exhibition space learners will develop their team and interpersonal skills, while presenting and speaking about their work in a professional manner.

The learner will cover concepts such as squash and stretch, path of action, arcs, timing, and volume. The concepts will be applied using different media: traditional pencil on paper, 2D digital software, and 3D digital software. "

Learners will do projects that involve designing characters, props and locations, storyboarding, and creating animatics. The whole production process will be discussed, as well as the importance of meeting deadlines and communicating with the team. "

The emphasis will be on one and two point perspective. Other topics will include ellipses, inclined planes, reflections, repeating objects, and characters. "
"6","Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC)","Digital Animation","https://www.nscc.ca/learning_programs/programs/PlanDescr.aspx?prg=DATD&pln=DA-NOCONC","DATD 1050","Painting and Composition","Painting and Composition In this course, learners will develop rendering skills using paint and other media. Lighting, shading and shadows are crucial for making images that feel three-dimensional. The colour wheel will be studied to develop an understanding of colour theory. A variety of techniques will be developed through research and experimentation. "

Short animated films will be screened and the techniques used to create them will be discussed. Drawing and/or animation styles and techniques will be researched and then emulated. Learners will also look at the basic visual components and aspects of film structure that aid in storytelling for animation including cinematic, emotional, aesthetic, symbolic, as well as theatrical reality, the suspension of disbelief and the illusion of life.
