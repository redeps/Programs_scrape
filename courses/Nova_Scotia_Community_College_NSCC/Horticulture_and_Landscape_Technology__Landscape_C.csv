"1","Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC)","Horticulture and Landscape Technology - Landscape Concentration","https://www.nscc.ca/learning_programs/programs/PlanDescr.aspx?prg=HLTG&pln=HORTLANDSC","HLAN 3001","Sustainable Turf","Sustainable Turf Sustainable Turf is an applied learning opportunity. Topics will range from soil cultivation, installation, maintenance and renovation, all with a heavy emphasis on integrated pest management. Learners will be provided an actual turf area to practice lecture theory. "
"2","Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC)","Horticulture and Landscape Technology - Landscape Concentration","https://www.nscc.ca/learning_programs/programs/PlanDescr.aspx?prg=HLTG&pln=HORTLANDSC","HLAN 3002","Landscape Maintenance","Landscape Maintenance During the fall semester, learners will practice plant identification, equipment operation, pruning, botany, soil science, Integrated Pest Management (IPM), and basic gardening techniques around campus or other sites. Learners will investigate various methodologies and discuss the potential of each method as they relate to the difficult realm of landscape maintenance. Each learner will be provided a case study area to hone his/her skills. "
"3","Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC)","Horticulture and Landscape Technology - Landscape Concentration","https://www.nscc.ca/learning_programs/programs/PlanDescr.aspx?prg=HLTG&pln=HORTLANDSC","HLAN 3004","Landscape Plant Materials II","Landscape Plant Materials II The focus of Landscape Plant Materials II is on identifying plant material in the autumn season using skills acquired in Landscape Plant Materials I and the universal language of Botanical Latin. Learners will be exposed to specific plant species, cultivar and variety. All plant material will be researched as they relate to family organization and their relationship with other plant communities. "
"4","Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC)","Horticulture and Landscape Technology - Landscape Concentration","https://www.nscc.ca/learning_programs/programs/PlanDescr.aspx?prg=HLTG&pln=HORTLANDSC","HLAN 4002","Landscape Installation","Landscape Installation This course allows learners to explore and practice many of the skill sets required for the Certified Horticultural Technician designation. A cross section of landscape installation modules will be represented in a plan. Each learner will build his/her own mini landscape in the indoor training facility at Kingstec campus. Learners will be expected to complete various projects and demonstrate an ability to operate a range of equipment. "
"5","Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC)","Horticulture and Landscape Technology - Landscape Concentration","https://www.nscc.ca/learning_programs/programs/PlanDescr.aspx?prg=HLTG&pln=HORTLANDSC","HLAN 4003","Plants in the Landscape","Plants in the Landscape Plants in the Landscape focuses on native plants and their allies in the natural environment. Emphasis is on recognizing dormant plants building on skills developed in Horticulture Science and Landscape Plant Materials I and II. "
"6","Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC)","Horticulture and Landscape Technology - Landscape Concentration","https://www.nscc.ca/learning_programs/programs/PlanDescr.aspx?prg=HLTG&pln=HORTLANDSC","HLAN 4011","Ornamental Pruning","Ornamental Pruning This hands-on pruning course provides learners with an opportunity to combine theory from other horticulture courses to prune actual plant material around the campus and in the community. Each learner will be expected to create “pruning plans” prior to making any cuts. Pruning will be based on species, age, condition of the plant and customer needs. This one-week course will be offered in the 6th semester of the program when weather and horticultural timing permits. "
"7","Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC)","Horticulture and Landscape Technology - Landscape Concentration","https://www.nscc.ca/learning_programs/programs/PlanDescr.aspx?prg=HLTG&pln=HORTLANDSC","HLTG 1004","Landscape Site Management","Landscape Site Management Landscape Site Management provides an opportunity for learners to apply their learning by developing inputs and making decisions that impact sustainable plant growth. Learners will manage either a closed environment site, i.e. greenhouse or a landscape site. Learners will further develop independent learning, self-discovery and practice “project management” skills. As the “green industry” moves to environmental sustainability and increased regulatory practices, learners can develop strategies and creative solutions that reflect the fundamental principles of horticulture. Learners will document their management practices to an acceptable industry standard, including any research materials that formed the basis of their decision-making processes. "
"8","Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC)","Horticulture and Landscape Technology - Landscape Concentration","https://www.nscc.ca/learning_programs/programs/PlanDescr.aspx?prg=HLTG&pln=HORTLANDSC","HLTG 1005","Research, Practice and Application","Research, Practice and Application This course will allow learners to manage specific Horticulture Operations and/or Landscape environments at Kingstec Campus or in the community. The course incorporates conducting practical experiments, conducting applied research, compiling data, managing the project, consulting with industry and developing supporting rationale to create the formal written and oral project results. The culmination of this project is to present research findings in a public forum. "
"9","Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC)","Horticulture and Landscape Technology - Landscape Concentration","https://www.nscc.ca/learning_programs/programs/PlanDescr.aspx?prg=HLTG&pln=HORTLANDSC","HLTG 1006","Landscape Analysis and Planning","Landscape Analysis and Planning The course is designed to provide a basic understanding of site analysis, customer survey and landscape planning strategies, exploring topics such as scale, plant symbols, plan layout and drafting tools. Learners will understand and practice manual drafting and computer-aided design (CAD) as they relate to the landscape planning process using established landscape plan protocol. "
"10","Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC)","Horticulture and Landscape Technology - Landscape Concentration","https://www.nscc.ca/learning_programs/programs/PlanDescr.aspx?prg=HLTG&pln=HORTLANDSC","HPRA 1100","Work Experience","Work Experience The work experience component provides the learner with an opportunity to apply skills and concepts appropriate for entry-level positions within the occupation. Learners will assess their own performance and be evaluated by an industry partner. Learners will identify personal outcomes they wish to attain during the work experience and will keep a journal. "
