They will be given information on the global seafood industry, how Canada fits in and how Nova Scotia contributes. The relative sizes of the wild and farmed seafood production will be noted and learners will be provided with information on how these sectors have changed over the past few decades. This information will lead into a description of the Fisheries and Aquaculture program, the material they will be exposed to and how that material will prepare them for work in the various sectors of the Atlantic seafood industry.

In this class, learners will acquire a basic knowledge about the oceanographic principles that lead to the productivity, tropic level composition and biological cycles within the local marine food chain. Students will learn about the various marine fishes and invertebrates that support the commercial fish and aquaculture industries. An overview of all commercially important species will be provided, and the biology and life cycles of the key species that are targeted by the commercial fisheries and aquaculture industries of Atlantic Canada will be explored in detail. Learners will study the habitat needs, nutritional needs, life stages, growth rates and reproductive strategies of the representative species. "

The major finfish and shellfish species will be covered. Both land-based and marine applications will be reviewed. Learners will explore the issues faced by the aquaculture industry and the opportunities the industry presents for sustained economic growth in coastal Atlantic Canada.Students will learn about the various research facilities that have been involved in the development of aquaculture and the work that they have dome. The habitat needs and growing conditions for shellfish and finfish will be studied so students will understand the water quality/habitat requirements and how to monitor/test for them. Environmental monitoring plans and techniques for marine sites will be studied. The developments over time in the field of diet formulation and feed conversion rates will be explored. The major biological risks for fish farms (diseases, sea lice, gear/line fowling) will be reviewed and students will be instructed on the approaches used by fish farm workers to monitor for these risks. Students will learn about biosecurity and the precautions that must be taken to minimize the risk of disease or organism transfer from one farm to another. "

From early salting and drying of fish to the massive plants that processed frozen fish blocks, learners will explore about how the groundfish processing sector evolved after World War II , grew after the declaration of Canada’s 200 mile limit in 1977, and attempted to survive through the groundfish collapse of the early 1990s. Learners will learn about the development of the snow crab processing sector after major increases in the resource were experienced in the 1990s. Learners will also investigate the other processing sectors including herring, lobster, clams and those that target aquaculture products. In addition to resource fluctuations, the processing industry has experienced a number of challenges in recent years including labour shortages as populations decline in coastal communities, competition from developing economies like China, aging infrastructure and overcapacity. Learners will explore these challenges as well as the future outlook for fish processing in the region in the face of stiff global competition and increasing demands for traceability and eco-certification.Students will learn about the technical aspects of the fish processing industry. They will gain knowledge of the equipment used in processing plants in the region as well as the processing techniques that are used for the various fish species. Plant cleaning and water use will be covered. Learners will explore how food safety concerns and principles are applied to the regulation of plant equipment and operations. The CFIA plant inspection procedures and rules (schedules I & II) will be covered, as well as requirements for plants exporting to the USA. "

These policies impact everything from who can get access to the resource to who can fish it once an individual or business gains access. Policies can be different for different fisheries sectors and gear classes. Some of the policies have a clear economic objective while others have more of a social and public policy objective. There are varying viewpoints on who should have access to or own Canadian fisheries resources. To understand these viewpoints, learners must understand the policies, the reasons behind them and who supports them.For the various fisheries, there are many industry organizations that represent the harvesting sector, the processing sector and in some cases, combined harvesting, buying and processing sectors. Many components of the fishing industry are not represented by any formal organization. Aquaculture Associations will also be covered. Learners will learn about the organizations, who they represent, their objectives and where applicable, how they are regulated.*Learners will attend meetings of various associations (harvesting, processing, aquaculture) to observe how business is conducted and what issues are addressed.
