The Clinically Intensive Orientation to Nursing in Ontario program is for Canadian Registered Nurses who are registered in either Ontario or another Canadian jurisdiction and have a letter from the College of Nurses of Ontario (CNO) stating they are out of practise hours and are required to complete theory and clinical hours to re-obtain their registration in Ontario.  This program is also for non-registered foreign-trained nurses who have met the educational requirements for registration as a Registered Nurse (RN) in Ontario and have been given permission to write the NCLEX but are out of practise hours and are required to complete theory and clinical hours mandated by the College of Nurses of Ontario (CNO) to obtain registration as a RN in Ontario.  This program is NOT for non-registered foreign-trained nurses who require further education to achieve their outlined competencies as mandated by the College of Nurses to achieve registration as a Registered Nurse in Ontario. Those competencies must be completed at a university.  This program is identical to Orientation to Nursing in Ontario for Nurses. The difference in the two programs is that Clinically Intensive Orientation to Nursing in Ontario is for those whose College of Nurses of Ontario (CNO) letter requires more than 400 hours of clinical, which will require another semester to complete.  This one-year Ontario College Graduate Certificate program prepares you to write the provincial registration exam (NCLEX), if required by the College of Nurses of Ontario, and meet the requirements for clinical practice, proving your skills are up-to-date.  This program is a review of the knowledge and skills you develop through basic education and workplace experience. Given the ever-changing technological world, however, this program is NOT meant for those who have spent a decade or longer away from nursing.  In this program, you apply theoretical knowledge during supervised clinical experiences. These clinical experiences may take place in a hospital, a long-term care facility, a clinic, or a community health setting. Nurses are provided the opportunity to meet the College of Nurses of Ontario requirements through these experiences, demonstrating the skills necessary for re-entry into nursing.  Employment may be found in a variety of settings including long-term care, acute care and community establishments, such as nursing homes, retirement homes and/or non-profit agencies.  Nurses must have current registration with the College of Nurses of Ontario to be eligible for employment. Nurses who are not currently registered with the College of Nurses of Ontario must write the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) upon successful completion of this program.

For more  information please contact your Program Coordinator. The Academic Planner provides registered part-time students in the Centre for Continuing and Online Learning (CCOL) the ability to declare into a program of study.

Students in the Early Childhood Education program complete three practice teaching field placements during their studies. These placements are assigned by the Online Learning Field Placement Officer with an emphasis on having students experience different early childcare environments during their course of study. Upon acceptance into the program, the following requirements must be met. Failure to complete these requirements will prevent students from participating in the field placement components of the course. Applicants must provide evidence of full and complete immunizations. ParaMed will review the student's record of immunization and provide authorization for entry into field placement. More information in this regard will be available to successful applicants.  Valid standard First Aid and CPR Level C Certification (St. John Ambulance, Red Cross or equivalent) must be completed prior to the commencement of classes. This certificate must be valid for the duration of the program. Successful completion of field placement is a requirement for graduation from the Early Childhood Education program. Agencies that provide placement opportunities will require you to have a clear Police Records Check for Service with the Vulnerable Sector (PRCSVS). Your acceptance for placement is at the discretion of the agency. If you register in the program without a clear PRCSVS and as a result are unable to participate in placement, you will not be able to graduate. To be eligible for placement, you must have submitted proof of first aid certification, PRCSVS and health authorization through ParaMed. You will be required to disclose the contents of the PRCSVS, including all notations, to the placement agencies. It is your responsibility to obtain the PRCSVS from your local Police 
Department prior to the deadline identified by your Department and to pay any associated costs. It may take 8-12 weeks to obtain this documentation; please submit your application as early as possible. Should you require further information, please complete this online form. In addition to field placements, students will be required to undertake observations and visit agencies. Many agencies require anyone visiting or observing children to have a valid Police Records Check. Students in Level 01 should obtain the Police Records Check before commencing studies. Students who have two or more F grades in a given term or whose term grade point average falls below 1.7 are considered to be on academic probation (Policy AA14 Grading System).

Sitting on the shores of the mighty Ottawa River, the Campus is in close proximity to world-renowned Algonquin Park, alpine ski hills and its program partner, Wilderness Tours. The Wilderness Tours resort is located just 30 minutes from the Pembroke Campus.  At least three weekends per term are scheduled for expeditions and/or practical skills courses. Students must attend these weekend programs. A schedule is distributed on orientation day. The electives offered are subject to minimum numbers, weather and logistical requirements. Not all electives are offered each term. Tuition fees include a number of significant industry certifications. Students may be able to earn industry certifications through the program at a significantly lower cost than if attained independently. Incorporating many certifications directly into the curriculum ensures graduates are qualified for employment. NOTE: Certifications are subject to change as all are regulated by separate national bodies.  Statement of Responsibility, Safety and Liability:In order to learn the skills necessary to become an effective leader in the outdoor adventure tourism industry, students must perform beyond the limits of a mere participant and assume a greater degree of responsibility and risk.  Course activities regularly take place in remote and rugged locations. Activities, including overnight camping and daily classes, are scheduled regardless of rain, snow and cold. Remote locations may mean delay in emergency communication and time to medical treatment in the case of injury. Within any given day, there is supervised and un-supervised activity and time.  There is an inherent element of risk which is beyond human control. Only those risks that contribute to career related skills, knowledge, and experience are acceptable, as dictated by industry standards, certification, licences and specific course outlines. This is termed risk appropriate training. Risks that fall outside of the scope of industry practice are deemed inappropriate for technical training programs at Algonquin College.

Statement of Responsibility, Safety and Liability:In order to learn the skills necessary to become an effective leader in the outdoor adventure tourism industry, students must perform beyond the limits of a mere participant and assume a greater degree of responsibility and risk.  Course activities regularly take place in remote and rugged locations. Activities, including overnight camping and daily classes, are scheduled regardless of rain, snow and cold. Remote locations may mean delay in emergency communication and time to medical treatment in the case of injury. Within any given day, there are supervised and un-supervised activities and time.  There is an inherent element of risk which is beyond human control. Only those risks that contribute to career related skills, knowledge, and experience are acceptable, as dictated by industry standards, certification, licences and specific course outlines. This is termed risk appropriate training. Risks that fall outside of the scope of industry practice are deemed inappropriate for technical training programs at the Waterfront Campus of Algonquin College in Pembroke.

In the event of an influenza outbreak, learners will be allowed to work on the outbreak unit if they show proof of their influenza vaccination and it is a well- matched year. 2. If the outbreak is a vaccine mismatch, learners will be allowed to work on the outbreak unit if they show proof of influenza vaccination and taking antiviral medication such as Tamiflu for the duration of the outbreak. The management and monitoring of Tamiflu for learners will be done by Algonquin College for the duration of the outbreak. Learners will be required to show proof. 3. If a learner has not received the flu vaccine at least 2 weeks before the outbreak is declared, then the learner will need to supplement with Tamiflu until either: 1) it reaches 2 weeks since the vaccine was given, or 2) the outbreak declared over. Placements will not accommodate moving the learner to another unit during an outbreak. 4. If a learner refuses Tamiflu and has been considered exposed, the learner cannot work in any clinical area for 72 hrs. 5. As other placement accommodations will not be made if a learner does not have the flu shot, and is on a unit with an outbreak, the learner accepts the risk of reduced clinical hours, with potential impact on successful completion of clinical placement.

The Social Service Worker program consists of courses that are delivered in a variety of formats including face-to-face in a classroom, hybrid (combination of classroom and online learning) and online courses. Students participate in all three types of learning. Students also participate in field placement learning activities. Class schedules vary from term to term and courses may be scheduled between the hours of 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. Friday. There is no flexibility in the assigned timetable. There is a significant workload in the program and students need to be prepared to make a full-time commitment to their studies and field placement in order to be successful.  Students may apply for transfer of academic credits from Algonquin College (internal transfer) or from other institutions (external transfer). College Policies AA09 and AA10 apply to transfer of credits. For more information visit: www.algonquincollege.com/directives. Students may apply for credit by challenging courses using Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition (PLAR). College Policy AA06 applies to PLAR. Students pay a fee for each course they wish to be exempt from and, through either a portfolio or challenge examination, a PLAR may lead to the acceptance of work and life experience in lieu of taking certain courses. For more information visit: www.algonquincollege.com/col/plar.html. Please note we do not PLAR any of our placements.  The social service worker field requires mature, flexible workers who commit to personal wellness and self-care as well as the principles of social justice and anti-oppression. This demanding program places students in learning environments and in contact with emotionally challenging situations. This may be unsettling to those who are in current recovery for mental health, abuse or addiction problems. As such, we encourage prospective students to reflect upon their readiness to meet these demands.  This full-time day program is also offered on the Pembroke Campus. While the learning outcomes at the Woodroffe and Pembroke Campuses are the same, subject delivery is reflective of the local circumstances which affect program delivery.  There is also an Intensive offering delivered at the Woodroffe Campus. This latter program is for individuals who have completed a degree or diploma (from an Ontario College of Applied Arts and Technology) in the humanities. Degrees outside of the humanities may be considered on an individual basis.  The College also offers the two-year Social Service Worker program on a part-time basis at the Woodroffe Campus in the evenings.  Part-time students who have successfully completed Level 01 and Level 02 in part-time studies can apply to come into Level 03 to finish the last year of the program in the full-time program.  Social Service Worker is a registered professional title which may only be used by members in good standing of the Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers (OCSWSSW). This relates to Ontario legislation entitled The Social Work and Social Service Worker Act. Graduates of the Social Service Worker program are required by law to join the OCSWSSW after graduation in order to use this professional title. The OCSWSSW grants or denies membership.

To see the BYOD requirements for your program, please visit: https://www7.algonquincollege.com/byod/.  Apply directly to the co-op version of this program through OntarioColleges.ca or our International Application Portal.  Cooperative education (Co-op) allows students to integrate their classroom learning with a real-world experience though paid work terms. Two academic terms prior to the cooperative education work term, students are required to actively participate in and successfully complete the self-directed co-op online readiness activities and in-person workshops.  Students must actively conduct a guided, self-directed job search and are responsible for securing approved program-related paid co-op employment. Students compete for co-op positions alongside students from Algonquin and other Canadian and international colleges and universities. Algonquin College`s Co-op Department provides assistance in developing co-op job opportunities and facilitates the overall process, but does not guarantee that a student will obtain employment in a co-op work term. Co-op students may be required to re-locate to take part in the co-op employment opportunities available in their industry and must cover all associated expenses; e.g., travel, work permits, visa applications, accommodation and all other incurred expenses.  Co-op work terms are typically 14 weeks in duration and are completed during a term when students are not taking courses.  International students enrolled in a co-op program are required by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to have a valid Co-op/Internship Work Permit prior to commencing their work term. Without this document, International students are not legally eligible to engage in work in Canada that is a mandatory part of an academic program.

As per policy AA39: Program Progression and Graduation Requirements when students are admitted to a program, they are assigned to the Program of Study that aligns with their start date. If  a student takes a break for two or more consecutive terms the Program of Study is reset to align with the current version (when studies are resumed). The Academic Planner provides registered part-time students in the Centre for Continuing and Online Learning (CCOL) the ability to declare into a program of study. The Academic Planner outlines successfully completed courses to date, as well as courses that need to be completed in order to meet graduation requirements. It is therefore, essential that all part-time students in CCOL declare to their program of study, allowing administrators to plan course offerings. The tool is available  on ACSIS, located under 'Continuing Education' on the left-hand toolbar.",
