Students will gain a solid knowledge of policy design and analysis and will learn to develop effective responses to the challenges that come along with these changes.

The extent and complexity of the problems mean that there are no simple solutions. One way to respond to climate change issues is to develop policy. Policy development must include scenario-specific analysis, design, development, implementation and evaluation.

Case studies focusing on the Yukon and, where applicable, Indigenous government settings, and or Indigenous communities, will inform policy development and decision making.

The study of the Earth is focused not only on the rocks and minerals that make up solid Earth but also on the interaction of these materials with other earth systems. An understanding of Earth’s evolution through time allows earth scientists to interpret present-day conditions on our planet and predict how they will change in the future; these changes will affect both human societies and the natural environment.

Earth scientists are stewards of the planet’s mineral, energy and water resources. They must also be problem solvers, as Earth’s natural resources are currently threatened by climate change, overconsumption and natural disasters. In the North, we live in a complex landscape where earth scientists must address the legacy of contaminated sites, support sustainable resource discovery and extraction, and grapple with a rapidly changing environment.

Students completing the two-year program will receive a diploma in Earth Sciences and be eligible for transfer into upper-level standing in many Canadian B.Sc. geoscience degree programs. A block transfer agreement between Yukon University and Vancouver Island University (VIU) allows Earth Science program graduates to easily transfer between institutions and directly apply all completed courses towards completion of a B.Sc. in geoscience from VIU's Department of Earth Science. 

Coursework completed at Yukon University is compatible with the educational requirements for achieving a professional geoscientist (P.Geo.) designation in the environmental geoscience or geology streams. Completion of a B.Sc. degree following the Earth Sciences program allows for upward workplace mobility in scientific and technical fields and enables graduates to continue to upper-level training in science (M.Sc., Ph.D.). 

Program pathways and duration

Students can complete the Earth Sciences diploma program with two years of full-time study. Part-time study is welcomed.

Explain the fundamentals of major concepts in earth science, including surface and groundwater; natural hazards; glaciers, permafrost and climate change; and mineral and hydrocarbon resources.
	 
	Explain earth processes in the context of plate tectonics and the rock cycle.
	 
	Identify the basic physical and chemical controls on the formation of minerals and rocks, and their fundamental properties.
	 
	Identify, measure, and interpret geologic structures and stratigraphy.
	 
	Explain events in geologic history using geologic evidence and place those events in the context of the geologic timescale.
	 
	Characterize geologic environments, past and present, in which rocks and other geologic materials are formed.
	 
	Apply geologic observations to interpret and solve real-world problems related to energy, water and mineral resource development.
	 
	Effectively communicate geoscience concepts and observations to their peers and the general public.
	 
	Describe indigenous perspectives on Earth evolution and geologic history (ethnogeology) and how those perspectives compare with Western scientific knowledge.
	 
	Demonstrate understanding of indigenous land claim agreements and current best practices for consultation in the context of resource development.
	 
	Safely work and collaborate in a field-based setting.

Theory and practice are planned to prepare graduates to work as caring individuals who assist clients/residents to achieve maximum independence in daily living.

This program is founded on concepts of caring, safety, critical thinking and decision making, and professional approaches to practice. These provide the underpinnings for the knowledge and skills that learners gain within the program.

Some courses are shared with other programs in the Univeristy to increase options for students who wish to further their education. This multidisciplinary approach promotes readiness for employment in the community by developing the student’s ability to function effectively within inter-professional teams.

MPA concentrations

In addition to the required core classes and the capstone course, MPA students must take four electives. UAS offers a number of choices for students to fulfill the elective requirement. A list of courses and course descriptions, including electives offered can be found in the Attachments.

Students have the option to use those four electives to earn an MPA general concentration or to pursue a special concentration in Natural Resource Policy, Municipal Governance, Higher Education Administration and Rural Development

General concentration
The MPA provides many opportunities for students to advance in their professional development. The general concentration is designed to give students freedom in choosing electives that best fit that development.

In this concentration, students can choose for their 12 elective credits any of the electives that are offered in the program. This allows students to define and develop their own plan that meets their current and future needs to be successful in their professions.

Natural Resource Policy (12 credits) (Enrollment currently suspended)
The Natural Resource Policy concentration addresses the need for professional management training in Alaskan natural resources and environmental management issues. Alaska with its abundance of natural resources and concomitant management issues are uniquely Alaskan as addressed in the State Constitution need unique management and sustainable solutions which this concentration provides. This program also supports and builds upon UAS’s strong undergraduate natural sciences and in particular the Environmental Studies program.
